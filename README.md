# Team 24 - Barclays Team-Graduate Allocation App

## The Project
For our third year team project, Barclays tasked us to develop an application that would automate the assignment of graduates to new teams in their graduate rotation programme.
We took this broad requirement and developed it as a Django webapp that takes in data input by an admin and matches graduates to teams based on their expressed preference using a maximum-flow minimum-cost algorithm taken from the NetworkX Python library.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
